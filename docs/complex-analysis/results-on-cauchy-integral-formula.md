Cauchy Integral formula is prominent in complex analysis. It results in many properties of analytic functions.

## Liouvilles Thorem

!!! success "Liouvilles Thorem"
    Any bounded entire function is constant.

**Proof:**


## Fundamental Theorem of Algebra

!!! success "Fundamental Theorem of Algebra"
    Any polynomial over complex field has at least one root.

**Proof:**


## Gauss Mean Value Theorem

!!! success "Gauss Mean Value Theorem"
    If $f$ is analytic inside and on a circular path centred at $a$ with radius $r$, then
    $$f(a)=\dfrac{1}{2\pi}\int_0^{2\pi} f(a+re^{i\theta})d\theta$$

**Proof:**

## Maximum Modulus Theorems

!!! success "Maximum Modulus Theorem"
    For an analytic function, the maximum value of modulus of the function occur on the boundary of the domain.

**Proof:** To prove this theorem we have to first prove the local maximum modulus theorem, which says the following

!!! tip "Local Maximum Modulus Theorem"
    For an analytic function defined on a domain $\Omega$
