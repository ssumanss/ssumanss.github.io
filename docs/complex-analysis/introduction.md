In this section we will define complex numbers as an extension of $\mathbb{R}$ as the following

$$\mathbb{C} \cong \mathbb{R}[x] / \langle x^2+1 \rangle = \{a+bx+\langle x^2+1 \rangle\ | ~
a,b \in \mathbb{R} \}$$

## Algebra of Complex Number
Addition of two complex numbers are done as follows




$\displaystyle a + b x + c + d x = a + c + x \left(b + d\right)$



Multiplication is done as follows




$\displaystyle \left(a + b x\right) \left(c + d x\right) = a c + a d x + b c x + b d x^{2}$






$\displaystyle a c - b d + x \left(a d + b c\right)$
